## Hi there, I'm Joe! ðŸ‘‹

I'm Joe, a software engineer working primarily with Python, Rust and Elixir!

I spend most of my time working on [Python Discord](https://pythondiscord.com/). When not doing that I'm also the Engineering Lead on the [Modcast Podcast](https://modpod.live/modpod-web-joe), a podcast about moderation of online communities.

I'm studying Computer Science at A-Level in the UK and will be starting university next year.

Check out some of my projects below and be sure to hit me up on Discord at `@joe#6000` or email `joseph@josephbanks.me`.
